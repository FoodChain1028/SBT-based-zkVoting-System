-   0.1.0 - Using [@phated's](https://github.com/phated/circom/tree/phated/wast-dep) `wast-dep` fork
    of circom which eliminates the need for `wabt` as a node dependency. The code for retrying
    folder deletions is more robust. Now `--version` includes the version information for the
    `circom2` npm package as well as the underlying `circom`. Specify compatibility with `node`
    versions 15.0.0 and higher (requires
    [i64 wasm](https://github.com/WebAssembly/proposals/issues/7) support). Updated `circom` to
    `2.0.3`. Added tests to check the behavior of the implementation.
